### 🚀 Software Development Projects

- **Computer Graphics and Computational Geometry in C++**
  - 🎨 [Bezier and B-Spline Curve Modeling Tool](https://github.com/DevChance/Bezier-and-B-Spline-Curve-Modeling-Tool): A simple yet robust application for creating and visualizing curves, leveraging advanced computational geometry techniques such as de Casteljau’s algorithm for Bezier curves and B-spline basis functions for smooth, continuous curve construction. This application enables users to dynamically adjust control points, modify knot vectors, and fine-tune curve parameters, offering a hands-on approach to understanding and applying the principles of curve modeling. 

- **Advanced Computational Risk Modeling and Prediction**
  - 📊 [Dynamic Risk Prediction Tool for Rail Crossings](https://github.com/DevChance/Risk-Model-Prediction-Tool): A machine learning model designed to predict risks at rail crossings in San Diego. It integrates dynamic datasets from **federal and local rail authorities** to analyze historical incidents, traffic patterns, and environmental factors. The tool provides predictive insights and risk visualization to support public safety initiatives, optimize resource allocation, and guide infrastructure planning. Its modular design allows for the integration of additional data sources, ensuring scalability and adaptability for diverse safety applications.

- **Efficient Data Compression and Decompression in C++**
  - 📂 [Huffman Coding Tool](https://github.com/DevChance/Huffman-Coding-Tool): A lossless file compression and decompression tool implemented using the **Huffman coding algorithm**. This project employs a binary tree-based encoding system to efficiently compress large datasets, reducing storage requirements while maintaining data integrity. It features modular encoding and decoding processes, validated with extensive testing to ensure correctness and performance. Ideal for optimizing data storage and demonstrating algorithmic problem-solving in C++.
